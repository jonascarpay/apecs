# apecs-stm is not in stack because it makes CI a huge pain.  The issue is that
# stm-containers and its dependencies are not on stackage.  It's by no means
# impossible or even difficult to build apecs-stm with stack, we used to do it
# on CI, but it was very fragile.  So, if you want to build apecs-stm with
# stack, for now, you'll have to add these dependencies manually:
# extra-deps:
#   - stm-containers-1.2
#   - stm-hamt-1.2.0.4
#   - primitive-extras-0.8

extra-deps:
  - vector-0.13.0.0
