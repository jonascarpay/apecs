-- When using 'cmap' or 'cfold' over a tuple of components, keep in mind the ordering of the tuple can have performance implications!
-- For tuples, the way the 'cmap' and 'cfold' work under the hood is by iterating over the component in the first position, and then for each entity that has that component, checking whether the entity also has the components in the remaining positions.
-- Therefore, the first component will typically be the most determining factor for performance, and a good rule of thumb is to, __when iterating over a tuple, put the rarest component in first position__.
-- 
-- Let's take a look at an example.
-- Consider a simple 2D rendering system built on top of `cmapM_`:
-- 
-- @
-- 'cmapM_' '$' \\(Sprite sprite, Visible) -> do
--   renderSprite sprite
-- @
-- 
-- While this rendering system works, it could be made more efficient by
-- leveraging knowledge of how the library handles reading of tupled components.
-- The usage of 'cmapM_' here (or any of the other map/fold functions) will
-- iterate over all entities with a @Sprite@ component and filter out any of
-- these entities that do not have a @Visible@ component. Depending on the game,
-- it is reasonable to assume that there are more sprites active in the game's
-- world than sprites that are visible to the game's camera.
-- 
-- Swapping the component ordering in the tuple is likely to be more efficient:
-- 
-- @
-- 'cmapM_' '$' \\(Visible, Sprite sprite) -> do
--   renderSprite sprite
-- @
-- 
-- Now the system iterates over just those entities that are visible to the
-- game's camera and filters out any that do not have a @Sprite@ component.
-- 
-- While putting the rarest component first is an excellent rule of thumb, to get the best possible performance, always consider how maps and folds are executed under the hood, and how you can order your components to optimize that process.
